# Libs selecteds

### Test app:

- Jest - It is the most used lib to test React libs nowadays. For me is a great lib to test component and snapshot tests, there are a lot of documentation on internet and it's the test lib indicated by React.

### Ensure code quality:

- ESlint - The best lib to ensure the code quality, help the developer to keep syntax perfectly, help the developer to find issues and solve problems related of their code.

- Prettier - The best lib to ensure how the code looks like. It helps the developer to define coomon style to the code.
