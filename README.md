## Selected Libs

### Test app:

- Jest - It is the most used lib to test React libs nowadays. For me is a great lib to test component and snapshot tests, there are a lot of documentation on internet and it's the test lib indicated by React.

<br />

### Ensure code quality:

- ESlint - The best lib to ensure the code quality, help the developer to keep syntax perfectly, help the developer to find issues and solve problems related of their code.

- Prettier - The best lib to ensure how the code looks like. It helps the developer to define coomon style to the code.

### Styling:

- Styled components: I selected the styled components to styling my test it's for me a good lib to make it, and what I'm more familiar with. It allows me to easily styling by state.

### Mock data

- Json server: It's a lib only to mock the data.
